This project is a music streaming program, using java, made in netbeans, and it is a program that a server handles incoming connections from the same network but different devices and clients can log in and listen to a list of songs

This application is a two-part program created for Academic purpose. The first part is the server, which listens for clients and implements a primitive distribution architecture to balance the load. The server is capable of user authentication, registration, and preventing multiple logins with the same account. It can send .wav files to the client or stream them. Additionally, the server allows users to see what other users are listening to through client-server-client communication.

The second part of the program is the client. The client can connect to the server by entering the server's IP address and initiating an automated handshake to establish the connection. The user can request services from the server and receive .wav files, which can be saved or played back directly from the app's music player. The audio player is fully featured, with the ability to pause, stop, and skip to specific times in the song.

The source code is well-commented, making it easy to understand, and the variables have descriptive names that correspond to their usage. This application is perfect for those who want to learn more about distributed systems and how they work.

In the PDF file named "Report for Distributed Systems Application project" is an extensive explanation of the project and also installation manual and user manual.

WARNING: the folder with songs is not included due to size restrictions, in order for the project to work either download the songs that i had already or use your own but dont forget to change the txt file with the titles in order for the program to read them and find them correctly in the server.


HAVE FUN!!
