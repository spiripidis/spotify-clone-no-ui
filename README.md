# spotify-clone-no-ui
This project is a music streaming program, using java, made in netbeans, and it is a program that a server handles incoming connections from the same network but different devices and clients can log in and listen to a list of songs


In the PDF file named "Report for Distributed Systems Application project" is an extensive explanation of the project and also installation manual and user manual.

WARNING: the folder with songs is not included due to size restrictions, in order for the project to work either download the songs that i had already or use your own but dont forget to change the txt file with the titles in order for the program to read them and find them correctly in the server.


HAVE FUN!!
